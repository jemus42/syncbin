# iterm2 utils

These are the utilities as per https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-utilities.html â€“ sadly I couldn't get the proper installation to work on FreeBSD, so I decided to just add the actual files to my syncbin. This is not ideal, as I don't have any interest in "redistributing" them and stuff, buuuuut okay.
